## A Note from the Developer

This plugin is a passion project and the largest I've undertaken. While it's in a pretty good state and offers a lot of functionality, please be aware that:

*   **Bugs and Edge Cases Exist:** You might encounter some quirks or unexpected behavior.
*   **Continuous Improvement:** I decided to release it for the community to use and benefit from, rather than waiting for absolute perfection. Feedback is welcome!

Thank you for trying Versatile Training!
